# Hackathons Team Matching AI :robot:

### TL; DR
This project was developed with the purpose of making better the team-making part of a hackathon.

### General purpose :unicorn:
Me and some participants of Shawee's 2019 OpenHack created a team. But we have had a problem. We didn't knew each other. So the purpose of this repo is to create a team matching AI that groups developers/people with a great features/knowledge variability.

### Technologies :wrench:
This repo is the back-end of a MVP. The technologies used are:
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- TensorFlow.JS
- Mongoose (with a MongoDB database)

### TODO :memo:
- [ ] Add continuous data feeding to improve AI models

### _Live_ ~server~
There's a _serverless_ lambda running this code at this moment. You can test it right now:
https://api-openhack.now.sh

### But, how can I properly test it? :thinking:
If you like using Insomnia, I created a workspace while I was developing the project. I just exported the workspace and added it to the repo.
You can download/view the file clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/developerdavi/openhack-backend/master/Insomnia%20Export.json).

### Final thoughts
Well, if you are reading this and liked this project, a star :star: of any kind of feedback would be really appreciated.

#### Thanks! :grinning:
